<h1 class="mw-headline">NeOn Alignment Plugin: User Documentation</h1>

<p>
The NeOn Alignment plugin panel is obtained by selecting "Windows" ->
"Show view" -> "Others..." -> "Alignment" -> "Alignment".
</p>
<!--p>To activate the NeOn Alignment Plugin from the NeOnToolkit Menu,
 click on the "Align" menu or the button on Toolbar, a view "Alignment
 Server" for the plugin will be opened.
</p-->
<p>
The figure below shows the available functions of the plugin.
</p><p><a href="Functions.png" class="image" title="Image:Functions.png"><img alt="Image:Functions.png" src="Functions.png" width="831" height="707" border="0" /></a>

</p>
<p>
The NeOn Alignment Plugin can work in two modes: offline and
online. Roughly speaking, the offline mode allows users to reach
main functionalities of the Alignment Server without connection to
the server while the online mode offers additionally mechanisms to
store and reuse alignments. 
</p>

<h2>Alignment plug-in commands</h2>

<h3>Online</h3>
<p>
Switch to the online mode in which the plug-in is connected to an
Alignment server and can take advantage of its stored alignements and
available matching methods. Only ontologies accessible on the web can be
matched in this mode.
</p>
<h3>Offline</h3>
<p>
Switch to the offline mode in which local ontologies are matched with
the matching methods available within the NeOn toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Refresh</h3>
<p>
Update the two ontology choosers (Ontology 1 and Ontology 2) with the
ontology available in the toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Match</h3>
<p>
Match the ontologies selected in the ontology choosers with the method
selected in the method chooser (a new alignment is created and is
available in the chooser of server alignments or local alignments
depending of the mode).
</p>
<h3>Trim (online)</h3>
<p>
Trims the correspondences in the alignment selected in the server
alignment chooser whose confidence is below some threshold (a new
alignment is created).
</p>
<h3>Import (online)</h3>
<p>
The alignment selected in the server alignment chooser is imported as
an ontology in the NeOn toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Store (online)</h3>
<p>
Stores the alignment selected in the server alignment chooser on
the server (it will be kept in the database and will survive any
server shutdown).
</p>
<h3>Import (offline)</h3>
<p>
The alignment selected in the local alignment chooser is imported as
an ontology in the NeOn toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Trim (offline)</h3>
<p>
Trims the correspondences in the alignment selected in the local
alignment chooser whose confidence is below some threshold (a new
alignment is created).
</p>
<h3>Upload (online)</h3>
<p>
Uploads the alignment selected in the local alignment chooser on
the server.
</p>
<h3>Find alignments for ontologies (online)</h3>
<p>
Fills the server alignment chooser with all alignments available on
the server.
</p>
<h3>Find all alignments from server (online)</h3>
<p>
Fills the server alignment chooser with all alignments between the two
ontologies of the ontology choosers (Ontology 1 and Ontology 2)
available on the server.
</p>

<h2>Using the plugin in local mode</h2>

<p>
In the offline mode, which is activated by clicking on button
"Offline", the NeOn Alignment Plugin can access to NeOn Toolkit
ontologies (i.e. opened ontologies in Ontology Navigator) and match
any pair of them. Resulting alignments can be stored as local system
files and imported to Ontology Navigator as OWL ontologies.

<a name="Show_the_Ontology_Navigator_view"
   id="Show_the_Ontology_Navigator_view"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Show the Ontology Navigator view</h4>

<p>From the Ontology Navigator, create a
  project, for example "OntologyProject", in this view.</p>

<a name="Open_working_OWL_ontologies"
   id="Open_working_OWL_ontologies"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Open working OWL ontologies</h4>

<p>From the menu bar of the NeonToolkit, open working OWL ontologies
  in the project "OntologyProject" created above by "File -&gt;
  Import... -&gt; Ontologies -&gt; ". You can select either "OWL2
  Ontologies from the filesystem" or "Import ontology from the web"</p>

<!--a name="Activate_the_Neon_Alignment_Plugin"
   id="Activate_the_Neon_Alignment_Plugin"></a>

<h4 class="mw-headline">Activate the Neon Alignment Plugin</h4>

<p>From the menu bar or the button, activate the Neon Alignment Plugin
  and a view for the plug-in will be openned.</p-->

<!--a name="Define_an_alignment_project"
   id="Define_an_alignment_project"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Define an alignment project</h4>

<p>From the view for the plug-in, give a name in the field "Alignment
  Project Name". This name will be used for an Ontology Navigator
  project which includes all alignments created by the NeOn Alignment
  plug-in later on.</p-->

<a name="Matching_two_ontologies" id="Matching_two_ontologies"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Matching two ontologies</h4>

<p>First we must fetch the working ontologies from Ontology Navigator
  by clicking on the button "Refresh". All the working ontologies will
  be added to two lists "Ontology 1" and "Ontology 2". Choose two
  ontologies to match from the two lists. Next, choose an alignment
  method from the list "Alignment methods". Click on "Match" to match
  these two ontologies with the method chosen. The resulting alignment
  will be  added to the list "Alignments found". See the figure below.

<a name="Importing_an_alignment" id="Importing_an_alignment"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Importing an alignment</h4>

<p>Choose an alignment from the list "Alignments found" and click on
  "Import to Ontology Navigator". The alignment chosen will be
  imported as an OWL ontology to the alignment project which was
  created in Ontology Navigator. Users can navigate the OWL alignment
  imported in Ontology Navigator. See the figure below.</p>

<h2>Using the plugin with the Alignment Server</h2>

<p>
In the online mode,  which is activated by clicking on button
"Online", the NeOn Alignment Plugin provides all functions from the
Alignment Server.  Resulting alignments are stored  on the server and
exported to Ontology Navigator as OWL ontologies. This allows NeOn
Toolkit users, with help of the Ontology Editor, to use, share or edit
alignments.
</p>

<a name="Activate_the_on-line_mode"
   id="Activate_the_on-line_mode"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Activate the on-line mode</h4>

<p>From the view for the plugin, activate the on-line mode by clicking on the button "Online" and the button "Connect" becomes enabled.
<p>

<a name="Connecting" id="Connecting"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Connecting</h4>

<p>To connect to the INRIA's Alignment Server from the NeOn Alignment Plugin, you have to type "aserv.inrialpes.fr" for hostname and "80" for port.<br />
If the connection is successful, we can see the buttons "Refresh", "Match", "Import to Ontology Navigator", "Trim", "Find an alignment...", "Store an alignment..." and "Fetch available alignments..." become enable. In particular, a list of available alignment methods is visible at "Alignment methods". In addition, an Ontology Navigator project, whose name was defined above, is automatically created for alignments.
</p>

<a name="Fetch_available_alignments"
   id="Fetch_available_alignments"></a>
<h4 class="mw-headline">Fetch available alignments</h4>

<p>This function allows users to obtain a list of all alignments
  available on the Alignment Server. See the figure below.</p>

<!--h2>How to use the NeOn Alignment Plugin with Ontomap Plugin</h2-->

<h2>Standard matchers</h2>

<p>
The Alignment plug-in comes with the built-in matchers of the
Alignment API not requiring extra installations (like WordNet).
We give below a simple description of their behaviour.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.SubsDistNameAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. The measure will depend on
the ration of the length of the longest common substring of both names
over the minimum lenght of these names.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.ClassStructAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the properties
that classes have in common. These properties are themselves compared
based on correspondences provided by an initial alignment.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.NameEqAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. The measure will be "1." if
both names are equal (after downcasing), and "0." if they are not.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.StringDistAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. In this case, the measure
computes exactly <tt>NameEqAlignment</tt> (this is a parametric
measures and the parameters are not available in the toolkit).
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.NameAndPropertyAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the properties
that classes have in common. These properties are themselves compared
based on correspondences between their names based on sub-string
distance (like in <tt>SubsDistNameAlignment</tt>).
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.StructSubsDistAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes, like <tt>StructSubsDistAlignment</tt>, an alignment based
on the comparison of the properties that classes have in common,
except that, in the present case, an optimal matching is computed
between the properties first.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.SMAONameAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. It is somewhat similar to
the <tt>EditDistNameAlignment</tt> but uses specific normalisation
strategies based on how computer scientists usually name things (it
knows about the Camel's notation, use of underscore, etc.).
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.EditDistNameAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. The measure is based on the
edit distance between the names of the entity to compare. It measures
the cost of transforming one string into another through insertion,
deletion and replacement of characters.
