<center><h1>Upgrading an Alignment implementation from version 2.x to
    3.0 of the Alignment API</h1></center>

<p>The version 3.0 of the Alignement API has been designed to provide
  matching algorithm designers more flexibility. In particular, the
  version 3.0 does not necessarily rely on the OWL API, so designers
  who want to use another OWL API can do so at no cost.</p>

<h2>Don't panic</h2>

<p>Those who already implemented an algorithm under the API will have
  to implement some changes for upgrading from version 2 to version
  3. But first do not panic. This document aims at helping you in this
  simple task.</p>

<h2>From Basic to OWLAPI</h2>

<p>Previously you certainly had your class
  extending <tt>BasicAlignment</tt>. You must now have it
  extending <tt>OWLAPIAlignment</tt>. This guarantee that you will
  still find all the features found in the
  previous <tt>BasicAlignment</tt>.</p>
<p>If you create on the fly new <tt>Alignment</tt> or
  new <tt>Cell</tt>, if they must contain <tt>OWLEntity</tt>, then
  be sure that they are created as <tt>OWLAPIAlignment</tt>
  and <tt>OWLAPICell</tt> respectively.</p>
<p>The new implementation of <tt>BasicAlignment</tt>
  and <tt>BasicCell</tt> provides additional new primitives such
  as <tt>getOntology1URI()</tt> and <tt>getObject1AsURI()</tt>.</p>

<h2>Parsing alignments</h2>

<p>If you used to parse alignments, you certainly
  used <tt>AlignmentParser</tt> which returned
  a <tt>BasicAlignment</tt>. Now the <tt>AlignmentParser</tt> returns
  a <tt>URIAlignment</tt>. To turn this <tt>URIAlignment</tt> into
  a <tt>OWLAPIAlignment</tt>, just
  invoke <tt>OWLAPIAlignment.toOWLAPIAlignment( URIAlignment )</tt>. It
  will return the corresponding <tt>OWLAPIAlignment</tt>.</p>

<p>Moreover, <tt>AlignmentParser.parse( URI )</tt> used to take a
  Hashtable as a second argument. This is not true anymore: you must
  suppress this second argument.</p>

<h2>Invoking your alignment</h2>

<p>For invoking your alignment class, the sequence used to be the
  following:
<pre>
AlignmentProcess al = new MyAlignment();
al.init( OWLOntology, OWLOntology );
al.align( Alignment, Parameters );
</pre>
(You may have used a <tt>MyAlignment( OWLOntology, OWLOntology )</tt>
constructor and no <tt>init</tt>. Now the sequence above is compulsory).
From version 3, the sequence is the same except that the arguments for init() are
the <tt>URL</tt> where to find the ontologies instead of the ontology
themselves. It is thus necessary for you to change your implementation
of <tt>init()</tt> so that it loads the ontologies. Moreover, the init
Alignent in <tt>align()</tt> is a <tt>URIAlignment</tt> and not
a <tt>OWLAPIAlignment</tt> so it may be necessary to change it as well.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the <tt>OWLAPIAlignment</tt> class already provides
  the <tt>loadOntology( URI, Hashtable )</tt> method that loads the
  required ontology and a <tt>loadInit( URI )</tt> method that will
  load the initial alignment.</p>

<h2>Report to us</h2>

<p>Please report any tweak that we did not mention here so that we can
  update this document.</p>

<h2>More</h2>

<p>You can look at the sources of the Alignment API which contain many
  examples. In particular, look at the <tt>Procalign</tt> class for
  example of the use of <tt>OntologyCache</tt>.</p>
